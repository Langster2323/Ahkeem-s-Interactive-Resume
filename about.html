          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Hey there! I'm a senior Philosophy Major from Eastern Illinois
            University, I created this website from scratch. I also am a dancer
            and I enjoy learning Programming languages and making websites or
            web applications. I love fulfilling each of my communicable expressions.
            I fulfill my spoken expressions with Philosophy, my unspoken expression
            as a dancer and my written expression with my ability to write code
            in different languages. I love linguistics! I enjoy learning about
            contemporary philosophers and phenomenologis and existentialist that
            bring up arguments and concerns about the "Self" and the nature and importance of aesthetic experience. Because I strongly believe there to be a world wide epidemic of the way we EXPERIENCE the world, and at home, at work, with each other, is in jeapordy. I also enjoy classical philology, logic and ethics, and hermeneutics. I love reading and studying philosophers such as Martin Heidegger, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gadamer, Immanuel Kant, Schopenhauer, Lyotard, Foucault, Aristotle, Zeno of Elea and Parmenides. After studying extensively with all these philosophers in classes. I came up with my own deposition and found myself with in agreement to what Heidegger and Nietzsche believed. In short they believed that for centuries Philosophy was misunderstood... that for centuries we misunderstood by what a Pre-socratic philosopher named Parmenides meant by the word "Being". For years we took his premises and conclusions to further mean... that we must find an ultimate being or there is one out there. But the word "Being" to Parmenides meant something entirely differnt then to what Plato and Aristotle described it to be.  So from there we thrived with and followed this blind desire of there being an ultimate being.  Philosophy then became purely metaphysical, which today it's known as "traditional philosophy", then metaphysics opened up domains of science such as: Biology, Physics, Psychology, Neruology and more. Which are all entities thriving ethically to find the truth or an ultimate being (not descritively of course). Then that action lead us to cybernetics to where now all the seperate domains metaphysics created, is now merging together as information. I believe that this long spiral of an action led us to where we are now, to where we have forgotten how to experience everything around us, by how our "Self" is in turmoil by simply misunderstanding what one man meant. We've done this many times before and we bullied our minds thinking that the truth resides in one entity, and in some sort of methodology based in our logic and ethics, but I believe it to be impossible for any truth to reside in a the realm of logic and ethics.  But instead resides within our experience, and our experience of not just one entity but of everything. I consider the Truth to be historical. Not immortal. But there is an origin from where the truth came from and I strongly believe through our experience of written expressions, spoken expressions and unspoken expressions, we could intuitively... aesthetically comprehend the true essence of being. And from there redefine together how we experience life, and to rewrite philosophy. Our experience provides us with impressions, and those impressions grants us ideas. By redefining our experience with not only the world by with eachother... we will and can change the way we think possibly (hopefully) for the better. I hope you can join me, help me in any way applicably, on this path to delineate our experience! Thank you and I hope you enjoy my blog! </p>
