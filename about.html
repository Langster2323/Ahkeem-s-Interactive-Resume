          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Thank you for checking out my LinkedIn Page. I would love to connect with you and build my network so please feel free to "LinkIn!" Here's my story... I am specifically trained in Ruby on Rails, I also have experience programming in languages like JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, SCSS, Java, MYSQL, and more. I've received a HTML && CSS fundamentals certificate from Sololearn and I'm currently working on a Java Certificate from Team TreeHouse. I've collaborated with front and backend engineers in an Agile work environment- and I've also applied tools like React.js and jQuery to Web Applications. I'm driven, ambitious, and eager to use my education and skills. I have the desire to always be learning and creating excellent code.<br />

<br />I'm well-rounded and comfortable communicating with all levels of professionals and staff in various industries. I am known as a team player and enjoy collaboration in an environment that promotes mutual respect.<br />

<br />I have a keen interest in Philosophy, specifically as it relates to the different natures of "what to think" and "how to think." It's an intellectual hobby that can bring on some mind-blowing discussion! Most interesting is how I can adapt this way of thinking to my programming and, in general, to communicating with others. I am also athletic and enjoy running, biking, playing sand volleyball and long-boarding. I have been on dance teams for several years attracted by the athleticism and self-expression it affords. I love to travel and would welcome the opportunity to do so through my career.<br />

<br />I was born and raised in Chicago and received my Bachelor's degree from Eastern Illinois University. I moved to Austin five days after graduation and immediately attended a code academy to jump start my career in programming. I would very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss my skills and ambitions and how I will be an asset to your team.</p>
